### Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col1">

In order to use PSKs, clients MUST also send a "psk_key_exchange_modes"
extension. The semantics of this extension are that the client only
supports the use of PSKs with these modes, which restricts both the
use of PSKs offered in this ClientHello and those which the server
might supply via NewSessionTicket.

`---snip---`

<!--
A client MUST provide a "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension if it offers
a "pre_shared_key" extension. If clients offer "pre_shared_key" without
a "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension, servers MUST abort the handshake.
Servers MUST NOT select a key exchange mode that is not listed by the
client. This extension also restricts the modes for use with PSK resumption;
servers SHOULD NOT send NewSessionTicket with tickets that are not
compatible with the advertised modes; however if it does so, the impact
will just be that the client's attempts at resumption fail.

The server MUST NOT send a "psk_key_exchange_modes" extension.

<div class="col2">
We model the client as always supporting both modes, allowing the server to
choose between `psk_ke` and `psk_dhe_ke`. Therefore, this extension is simply
```
  define(<!PskKeyExchangeModes!>, <!Extension('45', psk_ke_mode)!>)
```
where `ke_mode` is set locally to `<psk_ke, psk_dhe_ke> = <'0', '1'>`.

### Early Data Indication
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col1">
When a PSK is used, the client can send application data
in its first flight of messages. If the client opts to do so, it MUST
supply an "early_data" extension as well as the "pre_shared_key"
extension.

The "extension_data" field of this extension contains an
"EarlyDataIndication" value:

%%% Key Exchange Messages

       struct {} Empty;

       struct {
           select (Handshake.msg_type) {
               case new_session_ticket:   uint32 max_early_data_size;
               case client_hello:         Empty;
               case encrypted_extensions: Empty;
           };
       } EarlyDataIndication;

See {{NSTMessage}} for the use of the max_early_data_size field.

The parameters for the 0-RTT data (symmetric cipher suite, ALPN
protocol, etc.) are the same as those which were negotiated in the connection
which established the PSK. The PSK used to encrypt the early data
MUST be the first PSK listed in the client's "pre_shared_key" extension.

For PSKs provisioned via NewSessionTicket, a server MUST validate that
the ticket age for the selected PSK identity (computed by subtracting
ticket_age_add from PskIdentity.obfuscated_ticket_age modulo 2^32)
is within a small tolerance of the
time since the ticket was issued (see {{replay-time}}).  If it is not,
the server SHOULD proceed with the handshake but reject 0-RTT, and
SHOULD NOT take any other action that assumes that this ClientHello is
fresh.


0-RTT messages sent in the first flight have the same (encrypted) content types
as their corresponding messages sent in other flights (handshake and
application_data) but are protected under
different keys.  After receiving the server's Finished message, if the
server has accepted early data, an EndOfEarlyData message
will be sent to indicate the key change. This message will be encrypted
with the 0-RTT traffic keys.


</div>
<div class="col2">

In our model, when sending a ClientHello for a PSK handshake, we always allocate
a space for the EarlyDataIndication extension. However, depending on whether
we actually want to send the extension, we change the value locally:
```
  define(<!EarlyDataIndication!>, <!edi!>)
  define(<!early_data_indication!>, <!Extension('42', '0')!>)
  define(<!no_early_data_indication!>, <!'0'!>)
```
This allows us to pattern match on the server-side the client sending a hello with
the extension present or not. For example, the client always sends this extension
on the first PSK handshake attempt, but if the server sends a HRR in response
to the initial message, the client never sends the extension on the second flight.

As noted in the [PSK extension](#pre-shared-key-extension) section, we use
a pair of functions `mask, unmask` to capture the obfuscated ticket age mechanism, 
though it is not clear if this models anything interesting.

Currently, we do not model the EndOfEarlyData message.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col1">

A server which receives an "early_data" extension
MUST behave in one of three ways:

- Ignore the extension and return a regular 1-RTT response.  The server then
  ignores early data by attempting to decrypt received records in the handshake traffic
  keys until it is able to receive the
  client's second flight and complete an ordinary 1-RTT handshake, skipping
  records that fail to decrypt, up to the configured max_early_data_size.

- Request that the client send another ClientHello by responding with a
  HelloRetryRequest.  A client MUST NOT include the "early_data" extension in
  its followup ClientHello.  The server then ignores early data by skipping
  all records with external content type of "application_data" (indicating
  that they are encrypted).

- Return its own extension in EncryptedExtensions,
  indicating that it intends to
  process the early data. It is not possible for the server
  to accept only a subset of the early data messages.
  Even though the server sends a message accepting early data, the actual early
  data itself may already be in flight by the time the server generates this message.

`---snip---`

<!--
In order to accept early data, the server MUST have accepted a
PSK cipher suite and selected the first key offered in the
client's "pre_shared_key" extension. In addition, it MUST verify that
the following values are consistent with those negotiated in the
connection during which the ticket was established.

- The TLS version number and cipher suite.
- The selected ALPN {{RFC7301}} protocol, if any.

Future extensions MUST define their interaction with 0-RTT.

If any of these checks fail, the server MUST NOT respond
with the extension and must discard all the remaining first
flight data (thus falling back to 1-RTT). If the client attempts
a 0-RTT handshake but the server rejects it, it will generally
not have the 0-RTT record protection keys and must instead
trial decrypt each record with the 1-RTT handshake keys
until it finds one that decrypts properly, and then pick up
the handshake from that point.

If the server chooses to accept the "early_data" extension,
then it MUST comply with the same error handling requirements
specified for all records when processing early data records.
Specifically, if the server fails to decrypt any 0-RTT record following
an accepted "early_data" extension it MUST terminate the connection
with a "bad_record_mac" alert as per {{record-payload-protection}}.

If the server rejects the "early_data" extension, the client application
MAY opt to retransmit early data once the handshake has been completed.
A TLS implementation SHOULD NOT automatically re-send early data;
applications are in a better position to decide when re-transmission is
appropriate.  Automatic re-transmission of early data could result in
assumptions about the status of the connection being incorrect. In
particular, a TLS implementation MUST NOT automatically re-send early
data unless the negotiated connection selects the same ALPN protocol. An
application might need to construct different messages if a different
protocol is selected. Similarly, if early data assumes anything about
the connection state, it might be sent in error after the handshake
completes.

#### Processing Order

Clients are permitted to "stream" 0-RTT data until they
receive the server's Finished, only then sending the "end_of_early_data"
alert. In order to avoid deadlock, when accepting "early_data",
servers MUST process the client's ClientHello and then immediately
send the ServerHello, rather than waiting for the client's
"end_of_early_data" alert.

#### Replay Properties {#replay-time}

As noted in {{zero-rtt-data}}, TLS provides a limited mechanism for
replay protection for data sent by the client in the first flight.

The "obfuscated_ticket_age" parameter in the client's
"pre_shared_key" extension SHOULD be used by
servers to limit the time over which the first flight might be
replayed.  A server can store the time at which it sends a session
ticket to the client, or encode the time in the ticket.  Then, each
time it receives an "pre_shared_key" extension, it can subtract the base value and
check to see if the value used by the client matches its expectations.

The ticket age (the value with "ticket_age_add" subtracted) provided by the
client will be shorter than the
actual time elapsed on the server by a single round trip time.  This
difference is comprised of the delay in sending the NewSessionTicket
message to the client, plus the time taken to send the ClientHello to
the server.  For this reason, a server SHOULD measure the round trip
time prior to sending the NewSessionTicket message and account for
that in the value it saves.

To properly validate the ticket age, a server needs to save at least two items:

- The time that the server generated the session ticket and the estimated round
  trip time can be added together to form a baseline time.
- The "ticket_age_add" parameter from the NewSessionTicket is needed to recover
  the ticket age from the "obfuscated_ticket_age" parameter.

There are several potential sources of error that make an exact
measurement of time difficult.  Variations in client and server clocks
are likely to be minimal, outside of gross time corrections.  Network
propagation delays are most likely causes of a mismatch in legitimate
values for elapsed time.  Both the NewSessionTicket and ClientHello
messages might be retransmitted and therefore delayed, which might be
hidden by TCP.

A small allowance for errors in clocks and variations in measurements
is advisable.  However, any allowance also increases the opportunity
for replay.  In this case, it is better to reject early data and fall back
to a full 1-RTT handshake than to risk greater exposure to replay attacks.
In common network topologies for browser clients, small allowances on the
order of ten seconds are reasonable.  Clock skew distributions are not
symmetric, so the optimal tradeoff may involve an asymmetric replay window.

<div class="col2">
We model the three possibilities in the following way:
 - The server can always ignore the extension if the `recv_early_data`
   rule is never actually used.

 - We have the `hello_retry_request_psk` rule if the server wants to do a HRR.
   After this, the client will *not* send a early data indication, nor generate
   a `EarlyDataSendStream`.
 
 - Accepting data happens by using the `recv_early_data` rule.

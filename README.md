# KEMTLS model in Tamarin

We've been adapting the Tamarin model for TLS 1.3 to analyse KEMTLS.

We've made some small progress making notes / updating the documentation in the `docs/` subfolder and it lives at https://thomwiggers.github.io/TLS13Tamarin/.

The KEMTLS model lives at `src/kemtls`; the proofs are in the `lemmas/proofs` subfolder.

# Original README below:
# TLS13Tamarin
This is a Tamarin model of TLS 1.3

The most recent code is included in [src/rev21](src/rev21), however we provide previous
versions for reference.

For a detailed comparison between the specification and our model, please see:

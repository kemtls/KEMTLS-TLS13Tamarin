# KEMTLS model in Tamarin

We've been adapting the Tamarin model for TLS 1.3 to analyse KEMTLS.

# Original README below:
# TLS13Tamarin
This is a Tamarin model of TLS 1.3

The most recent code is included in [src/rev21](src/rev21), however we provide previous
versions for reference.

For a detailed comparison between the specification and our model, please see:
